Click “Add Expense”
The pie chart updates automatically to reflect your expenses.

 Example

Rent	$800
Transport	$50

These entries will appear as segments in the pie chart.

 Tips
You can enter the same category multiple times — the amounts will be added together.
Refreshing the page clears your data (no storage enabled).
Use meaningful category names to keep your chart easy to read.
